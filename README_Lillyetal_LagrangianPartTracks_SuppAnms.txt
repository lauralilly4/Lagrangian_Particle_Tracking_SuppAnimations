% Description of contents:
The above supplemental animations depict particle backtracks from the spring distributions of six euphausiid species off Central and Southern California to the prior winter (four month backtrack). Euphuasiid distributions were developed from data from the CalCOFI program, which consists of in situ measurements of euphausiid biomass on a set grid of sampling stations one time per spring, between mid-March and mid-May. We first objectively mapped the biomass values from the individual CalCOFI stations onto a smooth, interpolated surface to depict the distribution across the entire region for a single year. From that surface, we identified the threshold contours encompassing the regions of >80% biomass and 50-80% biomass for that year's distribution. We then seeded particles within those contours and ran them back for four months (Mar 31 to the prior Dec 1) to determine the winter origins of waters impacting each population in spring. The animations capture those particle backtracks. The associated datafiles and Matlab scripts allow the user to recreate the supplemental animations.


% Methods:
Distributions for particle backtracks were seeded based on actual species distributions measured by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program in Apr-May of each year. Dark blue particles originated from the region containing biomass values that were >80% of the maximum biomass value of that year (e.g., if max biomass for a year = 1 mgC m-3, dark blue particles were seeded for the region encompassing all biomasses > 0.8 mgC m-3). Turquoise particles were seeded for regions of biomass between 50-80% of a year's maximum biomass. Particles were backtracked using the Runge-Kutta interpolation method, with 100 interpolation steps per 24-hr period. Backtracks were forced by modeled u and v flow fields from the California State Estimate (CASE).

Forty-eight .avi files (10-15 MB each) total. Each file shows the particle backtrack from Mar 31 to the prior Dec 1 for a given year and euphausiid species. Not every species was present in every year. Individual files contain backtrack dates ('MarYYYY_DecYYYY').



% CODING STEPS
NOTE: You must separately download and format the file of euphausiid species biomass. A test file is provided for Euphausia pacifica; all other species must be requested.

1. Download Matlab scripts and datafiles
2. Place all datafiles in the same folder as scripts.
3. Email mohman@ucsd.edu to request access to biomass data for euphausiid species from the Brinton-Townsend Euphausiid Database (https://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/euphausiid/). Note that you can access the site directly as a public user, but you will only be able to download abundance data, not biomass. Request *untransformed carbon biomass* values for all available years and stations for the species you are interested in. 
4. From the dataset you receive, input the following variables into a .csv file, in order: RowNumber, Cruise, Mon, Day, Year, Line, Station, Region, Latitude, Longitude, Biomass
5. Add the .csv file to your datafiles folder, and in the Matlab script for 'Step2', Line 15, change the folder path and/or file name to your version of the file
6. Run the three files in order by 'Step' number. In Step2, you will be prompted to input 'Species name' and 'Input year'. The species name is to select which .csv file to run; the input year subsets the requested year for objective mapping and particle tracking. Input the species name in single quotes (') and the year without quotes.

	- NOTE: Although this structure has 'XC' and 'YC' variables, those are NOT used in this script because they depict a smaller subset of the CASE model. The versions of those variables used here come from 'grid.mat' (below). 
	- NOTE: Although 'grid.mat' has a z dimension for the full U and V files, we use the 'ZC' list of depths from this file because it is a subset only down to 485 m, and we do not need the entire 5000m suite of depths. We also specify a subset range of depths for the actual particle interpolations.
